## Database Tables

- Table `students`: _name_, _email_, _autogenerated_id_, _hash_, _salt_, _full_time_.   
  _full_time_: type of study plan (NULL: no study plan yet, 0: part-time, 1: full-time).
- Table `courses`: _code_, _name_, _cfu_, _max_students_, _mandatory_.     
  _max_students_: NULLable; _mandatory_: a NULLable course code referencing an eventual preparatory course.
- Table `incompats`: _course_, _incompat_.   
  _incompat__ references course codes, allow to reconstruct the incompatibility relationships between courses.
- Table `course_in_studyplan`: _course_, _student_.   
  A row of this table means that the specified course is in the student's study plan.

## Main React Components

- `Main` (in `App.js`): technically a component, takes the role of App and is rendered inside a Router to be able to use the useNavigate hook. This maintains most of the state of the app.
- `HomePage` (in `App.js`): proper home page, contains the list of courses and, when a student is logged in, their study plan as well. This component injects all the Contexts used throughout the app with their respective values.
- `CourseList` (in `CourseList.js`): the list of all courses. It is a wrapper around a Bootstrap Accordion component.
- `CourseItem` (in `CourseList.js`): a single course in the CourseList. When collapsed it shows the course's code, name, credits and current and maximum number of students. It can be expanded to reveal the course's constraints. When in a study plan editing session, this puts a small round button next to the accordion item to add/remove the course to/from the study plan, and is responsible for checking if doing so is valid.
- `CourseItemDetails` (in `CourseList.js`): the body of a CourseItem's accordion item. Shows the course's constraints as _CourseCodeHoverables_ and, during a study plan editing session, if the corresponding course can not be added or removed, it shows the reason.
- `StudyPlan` (in `StudyPlan.js`): when a student is logged in, this renders their study plan as a toolbar plus list of courses (or just the toolbar if no study plan has been created yet), and allows them to edit it.
- `Toolbar` (in `StudyPlan.js`): shows important information on the current study plan (like the number of credits) and the buttons that the student can use to save the changes, discard them, or delete the study plan altogether.
- `StudyPlanList` (in `StudyPlan.js`): the proper list of courses in the study plan (as a Bootstrap ListGroup component).
- `LoginForm` (in `LoginForm.js`): the login form that students can use to login into the app. This is responsible for the client-side validation of the login credentials (valid email and non-empty password).
